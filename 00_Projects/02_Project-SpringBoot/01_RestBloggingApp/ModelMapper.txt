ModelMapper :
	- It is a library.
	- used to map two objects with each other.
	- to use we need to 
		1) add dependency of ModelMapper in pom.xml
		2) in main class
			@Bean ---> to tell spring boot that u need to create object at runtime for this method.
			public ModelMapper modelMapper(){
				return new ModelMapper();
			}
		3) in that class where we want to use ModelMapper
		
			@Autowired
			ModelMapper modelMapper; ---> to inject modelMapper dependency automatically
			
			
			consider scenario, we need to convert User into UserDTO
			modelMapper.map(source,destination);
			
			public UserDTO userToUserDTO(User user){
				UserDTO userDTO = this.modelMapper.map(user,UserDTO.class);
				return userDTO;
			}
			
			NOTE : fields in User class must be same as fields in UserDTO class
